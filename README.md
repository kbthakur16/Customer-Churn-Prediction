# Customer Churn Prediction

This repository contains the implementation of a customer churn prediction model, which aims to predict whether a customer will leave a service based on various features. The project follows a typical machine learning pipeline including data preprocessing, feature engineering, model building, optimization, and deployment.

## Project Steps

### 1. Data Preprocessing
- Load the provided dataset and perform initial exploratory data analysis (EDA).
- Handle missing data, outliers, and anomalies.
- Prepare the data for machine learning:
  - Encode categorical variables.
  - Split the dataset into training and testing sets for validation purposes.

### 2. Feature Engineering
- Generate meaningful features to improve model performance and accuracy.
- Apply feature scaling or normalization techniques if necessary to ensure consistent scaling across features.

### 3. Model Building
- Select suitable machine learning algorithms for classification, such as:
  - Logistic Regression
  - Random Forest
  - Neural Networks
- Train the selected model on the training data.
- Validate and evaluate the model using performance metrics such as:
  - Accuracy
  - Precision
  - Recall
  - F1-score

### 4. Model Optimization
- Fine-tune model parameters to improve accuracy and generalization.
- Use techniques like cross-validation and hyperparameter tuning to avoid overfitting.

### 5. Model Deployment
- Deploy the model into a simulated production environment (e.g., development server).
- Ensure the model can accept new customer data and predict churn effectively.
